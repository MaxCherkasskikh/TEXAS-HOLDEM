    <h1 id='history_heading' style='background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)'>THE HISTORY</h1>

    <p id='history_paragraph1' style='background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);'>Although little is known about the invention of Texas hold 'em, the Texas State Legislature officially recognizes Robstown, Texas, United States as the game's birthplace, dating the game to the early 1900s.</p>

    <p id='history_paragraph2' style='background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);'>After the game spread throughout Texas, hold 'em was introduced to Las Vegas in 1967 by a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson, and Amarillo Slim. This is when "ace high" was changed from the original form in which aces were low. Addington said the first time he saw the game was in 1959. "They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em.… I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game. Draw poker, you bet only twice; hold 'em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game."</p>

    <p id='history_paragraph3' style='background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);'>For several years the Golden Nugget Casino in Downtown Las Vegas was the only casino in Las Vegas to offer the game. At that time, the Golden Nugget's poker room was "truly a 'sawdust joint,' with…oiled sawdust covering the floors." Because of its location and decor, this poker room did not receive many rich drop-in clients, and as a result, professional players sought a more prominent location. In 1969, the Las Vegas professionals were invited to play Texas hold 'em at the entrance of the now-demolished Dunes Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. This prominent location, and the relative inexperience of poker players with Texas hold 'em, resulted in a very remunerative game for professional players.</p>

    <p id='history_paragraph4' style='background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);'>After a disappointing attempt to establish a "Gambling Fraternity Convention", Tom Moore added the first ever poker tournament to the Second Annual Gambling Fraternity Convention held in 1969. This tournament featured several games including Texas hold 'em. In 1970, Benny and Jack Binion acquired the rights to this convention, renamed it the World Series of Poker, and moved it to their casino, Binion's Horseshoe, in Las Vegas. After its first year, a journalist, Tom Thackrey, suggested that the main event of this tournament should be no-limit Texas hold 'em. The Binions agreed and ever since no-limit Texas hold 'em has been played as the main event. Interest in the Main Event continued to grow steadily over the next two decades. After receiving only eight entrants in 1972, the numbers grew to over one hundred entrants in 1982, and over two hundred in 1991.</p>

    <p id='history_paragraph5' style='background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);'>During this time, B & G Publishing Co., Inc. published Doyle Brunson's revolutionary poker strategy guide, Super/System. Despite being self-published and priced at $100 in 1978, the book revolutionized the way poker was played. It was one of the first books to discuss Texas hold 'em, and is today cited as one of the most important books on this game. In 1983, Al Alvarez published The Biggest Game in Town, a book detailing a 1981 World Series of Poker event. The first book of its kind, it described the world of professional poker players and the World Series of Poker. Alvarez's book is credited with beginning the genre of poker literature and with bringing Texas hold 'em (and poker generally) to a wider audience. Alvarez's book was not the first book about poker. "The Education of a Poker Player" by Herbert O. Yardley, a former U.S. government code breaker, was published in 1957.</p>

    <p id='history_paragraph6' style='background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);'>Interest in hold 'em outside of Nevada began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although California had legal card rooms offering draw poker, Texas hold 'em was deemed to be prohibited under a statute that made illegal the (now unheard of) game "stud-horse". But in 1988 Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from stud-horse in Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp. Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em. (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a game of skill, but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker.) After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers Terry Rogers and Liam Flood introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s.</p>

    <h2 id='objective_heading'>THE OBJECTIVE...</h2>

      <p id='objective_paragraph1'>
      The game of Texas Holdem can take hours to play because the objective is to end up will all of the points at the end. There are four betting rounds. At the end of the four betting rounds whoever has the best matched hand wins the pot. In the case of similar hands the players split the pot. The betting rounds repeat until someone has all the points. This means that the player with all the points wins the game. Generally as you play you must try to guess which hand the other players have in comparison to yours and bet accordingly. As the cards are revealed you have to match your cards to the other five cards on the table to create a "hand". A "hand" is a predetermined combination of five cards out of the ones you hold and the ones that are on the table. The following are the predetermined "hands":
      </p>

      <ul id='hand_list'>
        <li>ROYAL FLUSH</li>
        <li>STRAIGHT FLUSH</li>
        <li>FOUR OF A KIND</li>
        <li>FULL HOUSE</li>
        <li>FLUSH</li>
        <li>STRAIGHT</li>
        <li>THREE OF A KIND</li>
        <li>TWO PAIR</li>
        <li>PAIR</li>
        <li>HIGH CARD</li>
      </ul>

      <p id='objective_paragraph2'>
      The above hands are ordered in terms of strength with Royal Flush being the strongest and High Card being the weakest. Royal flush means you have matched 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace all in that order with the same suite. This is an extremely rare match. The odds of you matching this hand are astronomically small. Straight Flus means means that you have matched any sequence of cards (like 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) with the same suite. Also a very rare match. Four Of A Kind means that you have matched four cards (like 5, 5, 5, 5) but not necessarily the same suite. Full House means that you have matched three of the same kind and two other ones of the same kind (like 3, 3, 3, 6, 6). Flush means that you have matched any type of cards within the same suite. Staight means that you have matched any cards in a sequene (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) but not in the same suite. Three Of A Kind means that you matched any three cards but not in the same suite. Two Pair means that you have matched four cards with two of the same and another two of the but not in the same suite (like 5, 5, 8, 8). Pair means that you have matched just two same cards but not in the same suite. High Card means that you haven't matched any cards and all you have is a high card. If no one matches at the of the betting rounds your high card will go against the other players' high cards. Whoever has the highest card wins the pot. In case of a tie the pot is split.

      <h2 id='rules_heading'>THE RULES</h2>

    </div>

    <div class='ruleswithparallax' id='general'>

      <p id='rules_paragraph1'>
      GENERALLY: The game should be played with at least two players, although typically at least three or four players are present. In our game we have four players; the main player (this is you), AI1 (artificial intelligence computer) named "Andrew", AI2 named "Daniel", AI3 named "Tony" and an imaginary "dealer". In some of the games a group of people will each draw a random card out of a shuffled deck and stick it on their forehead with the front facing other players. Each person in the group will take turns guessing two things: 1. players who they think has a higher card than them 2. players who they think they have a higher card than. So they will say something like "I think I have a higher card than Andrew and Tony but I probably have a card lower than Daniel". At the end everyone guesses their card number. Whoever has the highest card will be the first to start. BUT... In our game (considering that we are playing against computers) you will be the first to go. You will be assigned as the "small blind" and Andrew will be assigned the "big blind". Every time the betting rounds are finished and someone wins the pot the small and big blinds move over one player to the left (clock-wise). All the betting rounds are played in a clock-wise direction.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class='ruleswithparallax' id='overview'>

      <p id='rules_paragraph2'>
      THE OVERVIEW: At the start of the game each player will be given 50,000 points (or chips). The minimum bet will start at 500 points. The small blind will first post half of the minimum (250 points) and later post the other 250 points at the end of the first betting round. The big blind will post the 500 minimum points. Both the small and the big blind have no choice in whether they want to post or not. Following the big blind the other two players will have a choice to "check", "call", "raise" or "fold". The first player after the big blind is the first to have the choice to "check" which means that they are not betting any amount of chips and therfore defer the turn to the next player. The following players all have a choice to "check" unless someone "raises" by posting the minimum amount of points or more in which case everyone has to either "match", "raise" or "fold". As soon as everyone "mathes" or folds the betting round is over.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class='ruleswithparallax' id='betting1'>

      <p id='rules_paragraph3'>
      Before any betting will be done and any betting rounds will be completed the "dealer" will shuffle a standard deck of fifty two cards (with intentionally missing "Joker" cards) to make sure that there is no recognizable order to the cards. The dealer will than deal two random cards face down to each player. You will be able to see your cards but you will not be able to see the other players' cards. Once the cards are dealt to each player the computer will set the deck on the table and "burn" one card. After this the first betting round will ensue. Small and big blinds will post the required points and the following two players will have their choices.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class='ruleswithparallax' id='betting2'>

      <p id='rules_paragraph4'>
      As soon as everyone posts, matches or folds the first betting round is over. The dealer will than reveal the first three cards. Another betting round will ensue. Now the small and big blinds have moved over one spot to the left. As in the previous betting round the small and the big blinds will post their required points and the following two people will have the choice to check, match, raise or fold. "Check" means you are not betting any points and deferring your turn to the next player. "Match" means you are matching the amount of points the previous player has posted. "Raising" means that you are betting a bigger amount of points than the previous player (now everyone has to either match your point bet or fold). "Folding" means that you are folding your cards back into the deck and therefore will skip playing the rest of the round until the next one starts.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class='ruleswithparallax' id='betting3'>

      <p id='rules_paragraph5'>
      As soon as the second betting round is over and everyone either matches or folds, the dealer will reveal a fourth card. The next round of betting will ensue. As soon the third round of betting is over the dealer will reveal the fifth card on the table. One more round of betting will happen. As soon as there are five cards on the table and the last round of betting is over the remaining players will reveal their cards beginning with player that is closest to the small blind in a clock-wise direction. Whoever has the highest hand wins the pot. Players with the same hand will split the pot. If no one matched a hand at the end of the betting rounds the players will compete with a High Card. Who ever has a higher card wins the pot. In case the cards on the table match any of the predetermined hand combinations on their own and none of the players matched the players will compete with a High Card.
      </p>

    <div class='ruleswithparallax' id='strategy'>

      <p id='rules_paragraph6'>
      GENERAL STRATEGY: As you are playing through the rounds you want to try to guess which cards the other players have. The other players may not have a good match and all they are doing is "bluffing". So keep that in mind. You may also "bluff", however, this is a risky business. The other players may "match" and win the pot. Be mindful of this and bet accoringly.
